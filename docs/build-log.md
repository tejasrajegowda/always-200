# Build log

What was built, in order, and why.

## Step 1: repo setup

- **Layout.** A flat application layout with three top-level packages (`patient/`, `traffic/`,
  `always_200/`); see [ADR 0001](decisions/0001-repo-structure.md). Only `always_200/` exists so
  far, holding the version string.
- **Environment.** Python 3.12, managed by uv. `uv.lock` pins every version, and CI installs with
  `uv sync --locked`, so it fails if the lock and `pyproject.toml` disagree.
- **Checks.** ruff (lint rules E, F, I, UP, B; 100-character lines), `ruff format --check`, and
  pytest. Tests marked `docker` are skipped by default and never run in CI.
- **Commit checks.** Every commit goes through `scripts/commit.py`, which refuses an empty,
  multi-line or over-100-character message, runs the same three checks as CI, stages, and runs the
  guard (`scripts/guard.py`) before committing. The guard refuses local-only paths (built-in and
  local), absolute user-folder paths, forbidden words from a local list, secret-shaped strings,
  trailer lines in messages, files over 2 MB (`docs/demo.gif` may be up to 10 MB) and an
  unexpected author identity. It fails closed when its local configuration is missing or its word
  list is empty. The same guard runs from the git hooks in `.githooks/`, including before every
  push.
- **Line endings.** `.gitattributes` stores text with LF, so the shell hooks run on every platform.
- **CI.** GitHub Actions runs ruff and pytest on every push and pull request, with read-only
  repository permissions and no network access beyond installing the locked dependencies.
- **Licence.** MIT for the code. The dataset will be published separately under CC BY 4.0.
